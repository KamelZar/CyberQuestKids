        "question": "An Artificial Intelligence can predict your personal and professional future with 100% accuracy",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! No AI can predict the future with certainty. It can make estimates based on data, but the future remains unpredictable!"

      {
        "question": "Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa listen and record everything you say at home permanently",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's partly FALSE! They listen for the activation word ('Hey Siri', 'Alexa') but normally only record after hearing that word. But there can be bugs..."

        "question": "Artificial Intelligence can help you with your homework, but you must always verify its answers and respect the rules",
        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! AI can help you understand and learn, but be careful: using AI to do your homework for you is plagiarism! Plus, your school might forbid it. AI should be a learning tool, not a way to cheat!"

        "question": "Deepfakes (AI-manipulated videos) are easy to create and can fool anyone without exception",
        "answer": false,

        "question": "An Artificial Intelligence can perfectly copy someone's voice with just a few seconds of recording",
        "answer": true,

        "question": "The phenomenon of 'hallucinations' (inventing false information) only exists in humans, not in AIs",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! AIs can also have 'hallucinations'! That means they invent information that seems true but is completely false. For example, an AI can invent historical dates or names of people who don't exist!"

        "question": "All Artificial Intelligences can do exactly the same tasks: write text, create images, videos, code...",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! Each AI has its specialty! There are AIs for coding (like GitHub Copilot), others for creating images (DALL-E, Midjourney), videos (RunwayML), analyzing texts, doing scientific research, or generating music. Each AI is trained for a specific task!"

        "question": "It's important to never give sensitive personal information to a chatbot or AI assistant",
        "answer": true,

        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! That's why you need to develop critical thinking and learn to identify clues of AI-generated content (repetitions, inconsistencies, overly perfect style...)"

        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! And you can detect it because: your phone becomes abnormally hot even at rest, the battery drains super fast, apps are slow to open, and you notice weird data consumption. If your phone does this for no reason, scan it!"

      {
        "question": "A virus can completely lock your phone and demand money",
        "answer": true,

        "question": "A VPN (virtual private network) can protect your privacy, but all free VPNs are safe",
        "answer": false,

        "question": "You can easily detect if your Android phone is infected by looking at the list of installed applications",
        "answer": true,

        "question": "If you lose your phone, someone can easily access all your banking apps",
        "answer": false,

        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's partly FALSE! Even though it's much safer, some malicious apps sometimes pass the controls. Read reviews, check requested permissions, and be wary of apps with very few downloads."

        "question": "A free app can make money by selling your personal data",
        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! If it's free, it's often because YOU are the product. Read the terms of use and privacy settings. Sometimes it's better to pay a few euros for an app that respects your privacy."

        "question": "Allowing geolocation on all your apps lets companies create a detailed profile of your habits",
        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! Your movements reveal where you live, work, shop, your leisure... Enable geolocation only for apps that really need it (maps, weather, delivery)."

        "question": "Using a password manager on your phone is risky because if someone steals your phone, they have all your passwords",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! A good password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane) encrypts everything with a master password. Even with your phone, impossible to access passwords without this code. And it's still infinitely safer than 'password123' everywhere!"

      {
        "question": "Messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram automatically encrypt all your messages",
        "answer": false,

        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's increasingly FALSE! With modern graphics cards, 8 characters can be cracked in a few hours. Aim for 12+ characters instead, or better: a passphrase of 4-6 random words!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Using the same password everywhere but very complex is safer than having different but simpler passwords",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! If a site gets hacked and your password leaks, ALL your accounts are compromised. Better to have unique passwords everywhere, even less complex ones."

        "question": "A password manager is safer than remembering all your passwords in your head",
        "answer": true,

        "question": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) by SMS is the safest method",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! SMS can be intercepted (SIM swapping, interception). Better to use an authentication app (Google Authenticator, Authy) or ideally a physical key (YubiKey)."

      {
        "question": "Changing your passwords every month improves security",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's FALSE! Changing too often pushes people to use weak or predictable passwords. Better to have a very strong password that you only change if there's a security breach."

        "question": "Security questions like 'your mother's maiden name' are a good recovery system",

        "question": "Sharing a Netflix or Spotify password with family/friends poses no security problem",
        "answer": false,
        "explanation": "That's partly FALSE! The main risk is that someone accidentally uses that password elsewhere. Or if the relationship deteriorates, you have to remember to change the password. Otherwise indeed, for streaming, the risk remains limited."

      {
        "question": "Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) are safe enough to save your passwords",
        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's increasingly TRUE! Modern browsers encrypt passwords well and sync between devices. It's better than nothing at all! But a dedicated manager remains more complete and portable."

        "question": "There exists a huge secret database that contains all the passwords in the world",
        "answer": false,

        "answer": true,
        "explanation": "That's TRUE! A ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace paralyzed check-in systems at major airports like Heathrow, Brussels and Berlin for several days. Staff had to return to manual methods: handwritten boarding passes, iPads for check-in... A real trip back in time! A suspect was arrested in the UK. This attack shows how much our infrastructure depends on technology and how crucial it is to protect it well!"

His real first name 'Markus' was never a mystery anyway, it's publicly known! However, Minecraft does contain real Easter eggs, like the text 'Minceraft' that sometimes appears instead of 'Minecraft' on the title screen.
